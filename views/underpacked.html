				<h2>Underpacked - Master Degree Project</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Underpacked! is a chaotic, cooperative 3D space adventure with a stylized cartoon aesthetic and a sharp
				sense of humor. Developed by Spanish indie studio Drunken Duck Co., the game places players in the role
				of overworked intergalactic delivery workers. Whether solo or in co-op (with a friend or a robotic AI
				companion), players must manage a dilapidated spaceship, fight off space threats, and deliver
				color-coded packages to customers across the galaxy—all under tight deadlines and relentless pressure.
				Inspired by the frantic gameplay of titles like Overcooked, Underpacked! combines fast-paced action,
				resource management, and teamwork in a satirical world of corporate absurdity. Players will generate
				packages, paint them, load them into delivery turrets, and fend off space pirates—all while trying to
				keep the ship from falling apart.
			</p>
			<p>
				On this project, I contributed to a wide range of areas, including gameplay mechanics, visual effects,
				technical art, and optimization. My work helped shape the core experience and polish the final product.
			</p>
			<div class="project-list">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Gameplay Mechanics:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Designed and implemented turret functionality, supporting multiple ammo types (standard,
								Package, and the possibility of more using DataAssets), each with unique effects on
								enemies and ship systems, adding tactical
								depth to combat.</li>
							<li>Developed interactive ship elements such as hull breaches, mailbox movement, and respawn
								capsule logic, ensuring dynamic and engaging ship management that requires constant
								player attention and teamwork.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Visuals & Animation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Created and integrated the player animation system, including smooth transitions,
								contextual feedback for actions, and unique animations for different states (repairing,
								shooting, carrying packages).</li>
							<li>Developed bot visual cues, enemy animations, and interactable object animations to
								enhance clarity and immersion, making the chaotic gameplay readable and visually
								appealing.</li>
							<li>Worked closely with artists to ensure a cohesive cartoon style throughout all character
								and environment animations.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Technical Art:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Built in-game tube and cable generators for dynamic ship interiors, allowing for
								procedural placement and visual variety that adapts to ship damage and repairs.</li>
							<li>Implemented holographic displays and UI elements for in-game feedback, navigation, and
								mission status, improving player awareness and decision-making.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Visual Effects (VFX):</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Created impactful explosion, shooting, and hull breach effects to provide satisfying
								feedback during intense moments.</li>
							<li>Developed a variety of particle effects, including smoke, fire, paw prints, electricity,
								thruster effects, repair visuals, and background elements like asteroids and nebulae,
								enriching the game's atmosphere.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Post-processing & Audio:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Implemented post-processing effects such as outlines, hit flashes, and color grading to
								enhance the game's visual style and communicate gameplay states (damage, alerts,
								power-ups).</li>
							<li>Integrated FMOD for audio implementation, adding all sound effects and dynamic music
								layers to ensure a cohesive and immersive soundscape that reacts to gameplay events.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Optimization & QA:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Optimized the game using Unreal's profiler, frame debugger, and memory profiler to
								ensure
								smooth performance, even during the most chaotic gameplay sequences.</li>
							<li>Conducted QA testing, bug fixing, and extensive playtesting, iterating on feedback to
								deliver a polished and enjoyable experience for both solo and co-op players.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
